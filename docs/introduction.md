# Introduction

At RISE, we often work in cooperation with other organizations with respect to applied research and innovation in Natural Language Processing (NLP). A major challenge that we often encounter is a lack of readiness with respect to data. Even if the research problem is sufficiently well defined, and the business value of the proposed solution is well described, it is often not clear what type of data is required, if it is available, or if it even exists at all. We find that there is often not even a framework available to discuss issues related to data. The purpose of this document is to outline and highlight issues related to data accessibility, validity, and utility that may arise in such situations. We hope that this document may serve as a guide for working practically with data in the context of applied NLP.


## Scope

This document is concerned with data readiness in the context of NLP. Thus, other modalities such as images, video, speech or sensor data are not covered, but similar considerations apply in those cases. 

## How to use this document

The intention is for the NLP data readiness document to provide insights into the type of challenges one might 
encounter, with respect to data, when embarking on a project involving natural language processing. The document is focused
on asking the right questions rather than providing an explicit guide that covers all possible challenges in a project: 
such a guiding will inevitably vary with the specific task at hand. 

* [Data Readiness Levels](data-readiness-levels.md) introduces the notion of data readiness.
* [Project phases](project-phases.md) outlines the typical structure of a research or innovation project, and puts data readiness into context within that structure. 
* [Questions for guidance](questions-for-guidance.md) is the central part of the *NLP data readiness* document. Use the questions to understand the data readiness of your own project.
* [Resources](resources.md) is a collection of links to resources related to this document.
* [How to contribute](contribute.md) contains instructions for how to help us improve the document. Please, reach out with any questions, or suggestions!
